C program vs Java program
C: Fast, prerequisite is low
Java: Slow, requires bigger OS + Java VM (Not good for small devices.)
C program directly manipulates memory (powerful but not secure.)
int * p = &a; 		      /*declare a pointer-type
printf("%ld", (long)(p));     of variable named p, initialize
*p = 3;                 	to variable a. in a declaration "*"
printf("%i", (*p));           stands for pointer type. "*" also means "de-reference",
                 			retrieving the value at the memory location, using the
                 			Syntax *p. */
output:
140735738981660

140 billion(140 TB)

p = (int*)malloc(100*sizeof(int)); 
printf("%i\n", p[0]);
printf("%i\n", p[100]); // out of bounds throw error or throws 0
OUTPUT:
0

malloc(dynamic memory allocation)
*(p+66)=p[66] //stands for starting at p, offset 66 position, 
		  read the value at new location
java equivalent:
p = new int[100];
